# create

- first you open a text editor to configure how
  your database is gonna be structured

- inserting one at a time

  ```
  db.posts.insert({
    title: 'Post One',
    body: 'Body of post one',
    category: 'News',
    likes: 4,
    tags: ['news', 'events'],
    user: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      status: 'author'
    },
    date: Date()
  })
  ```

- inserting more than one at a time
  <br>

  ```
  db.posts.insertMany([
    {
      title: 'Post Two',
      body: 'Body of post two',
      category: 'Technology',
      date: Date()
    },
    {
      title: 'Post Three',
      body: 'Body of post three',
      category: 'News',
      date: Date()
    },
    {
      title: 'Post Four',
      body: 'Body of post four',
      category: 'Entertainment',
      date: Date()
    }
  ])
  ```

  something to note:
  <br>
  you don't really have to have constraint like those that you have using sql
  (you can put anything that you want in your database)
