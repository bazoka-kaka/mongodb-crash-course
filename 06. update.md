# update

1. replacing the entire thing:

```
db.posts.update({title: "Post Two"}, {
  title: "Post Two",
  body: "New post 2 body",
  date: Date()
}, {
  upsert: true
})
```

note:

- upsert --> if not found, insert it
- usually we update things according to their id

2. replacing just some part

```
db.posts.update({title: "Post Two"}, {
  $set: {
    body: "Body of post 2",
    category: "Technology"
  }
})
```

note:
<br>
this is gonna insert anything inside set
if something there isn't defined yet previously,
but if it's defined, it's not gonna replace the entire document
just the things defined in $set

- increment
  <br>
  ```
  db.posts.update({title: "Post Two"}, {
    $inc: {
      likes: 2
    }
  })
  ```
  this is gonna increment the likes by 2
- rename
  <br>
  ```
  db.posts.update({ title: "Post Two"}, {
    $rename: {
      likes: "views"
    }
  })
  ```
  this is gonna rename "likes" to "views"
